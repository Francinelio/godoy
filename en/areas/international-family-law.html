                    The Haya Convention and International Kidnapping
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Haya Convention and International Kidnapping. International Abduction, Subtraction or Illicit Removal of Children occurs when one of the Parents removes the child from the country of his or her habitual residence, injuring the custody of the other parent. It is also called international kidnapping of children, subject dealt with during the Hague Convention.

                <p>
                    Legal discipline is given by the Hague Convention on the civil effects of the International Kidnapping. The Convention is in force in Brazil by Decree 3413/00. The Convention is one of the most successful International Treaties of Civil Law of International Law, with numerous signatory countries.

                    Under the Convention, the right of custody includes the right to decide on the residence of the minor. Therefore, even non-custodial parents may, in accordance with the family law of their home country, have to consent to an international change of address. When this agreement does not occur and the other parent takes the child to another country, we are facing illicit removal.

                <p>
                    The envisaged legal solution is the return of the minor. It is up to the judiciary of the country of habitual residence to decide on the modification of the child's domicile. However, in some situations the return may be denied, even in accordance with the Convention.
