                        The most valuable companies in the digital economy build their competitive advantage based on innovation. In this context, sound management of intellectual and industrial property is crucial, as it is the tool that allows us to obtain exclusive rights to the assets in which innovation resides. Among others, we should ask the following questions: How to protect the algorithms? What rights do I need to get for setting up a content platform? Who owns the works created by AI? How to protect big data? What precautions should we take when buying a technology company?
